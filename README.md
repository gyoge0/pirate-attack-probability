# Pirate Attack Probability

This machine learning model predicts the possibility of a pirate attack at a given location.

It makes use of data from Open Street Map and geopandas to make visualizations.

## Data

The model is trained on [Global Maritime Pirate Attacks (1993â€“2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/n0n5ense/global-maritime-pirate-attacks-19932020)
from Kaggle. It expects `pirate_attacks.csv` to be within the top directory. 

Visualizations are made with [Open Street Map data for coastlines](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/coastlines.html)
which it expects within the `coastlines` directory.

## Images

All plots generated can be found within the images directory.
